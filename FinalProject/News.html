<h1> Star Wars: The Force Awakens

Blockbuster films are typically accompanied by video game tie-ins. A few years ago those games took the form of console titles that told largely the same story as the film, but more recently they’ve shifted to mobile, where it’s faster and cheaper to develop a game alongside a movie. No matter the platform, though, these games are almost universally terrible. Because of this, the most anticipated movie of 2015 won’t have a standard movie game — instead it’ll have many smaller tie-ins. While there’s no game called Star Wars: The Force Awakens, there’s a whole slate of titles that touch on J.J. Abrams’ new film through downloadable content and other add-ons.

	The biggest piece in the Star Wars onslaught is Battlefront, a multiplayer shooter that takes place during the events of the original trilogy. It’s essentially nostalgia in video game form, complete with startlingly accurate sound design. But a new add-on released this week lets players explore the "Battle of Jakku," an event alluded to in the upcoming movie, but never really explored before (it’s the reason you see all of those downed Star Destroyers rusting away in the desert in the trailers). But Battlefront is far from the only game to touch on the new film. Disney Infinity 3.0, the first game in the toys-to-life series to introduce Star Wars characters, will launch an expansion on December 18th that covers the new movie, and includes toys based on characters like Finn, Rey, and Kylo Ren.

	There are also a number of mobile games. Strategy title Star Wars: Commander, which originally launched last year, was recently updated with new units and a planet inspired by The Force Awakens, while Star Wars: Uprising — an RPG that takes place between Return of the Jedi and the new film — is introducing a new update today that lets players learn Force powers and even wield a lightsaber. It’s a sizable update that brings the game closer to the movie in terms of the timeline. Meanwhile, EA just launched Galaxy of Heroes, which mashes together characters from every era of Star Wars for a free-to-play, collectible RPG where you create teams of iconic characters from the series.
